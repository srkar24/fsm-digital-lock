**Digital Lock Implementation on Zybo Development Board**

This project implements a digital lock system on the Zybo Development Board. The user can unlock the lock by entering a specific sequence of keys, cancel and re-enter a new combination, and exit an alarm condition by entering a specific combination. We need to follow the provided FSM for this project. Note that the correct input pattern should be SWEW (South, West, East, West) to unlock.
